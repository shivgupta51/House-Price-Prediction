# House-Price-Prediction
Situation: Developed an accurate property price prediction model, addressing data cleaning and preprocessing challenges due to missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.

Task: Responsible for end-to-end data preprocessing, which included thorough data cleaning, feature engineering, outlier removal, effective handling of categorical variables using one-hot encoding, and using a linear regression model.

Action: Conducted meticulous data cleaning, resolved missing values, and handled duplicate records. Engineered features to extract valuable insights, detected and eliminated outliers, and transformed categorical variables. Ensured model reliability through K-fold cross-validation. Leveraged scatter plots for data visualization.

Result: Successfully delivered a high-accuracy real estate price prediction model, achieving an impressive 0.891 R-squared score. This model forecasts property prices based on location, square footage, and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms (BHK), empowering more informed real estate investment decisions.
